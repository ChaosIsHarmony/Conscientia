		*The refreshing aromas of a pristine cedar forest offers a welcome relief from the dank underhalls of the Enclave. None of his Order ever need to set foot outside, save for the Itinerant caste on their recruitment missions. Thus, Ormenos finds himself alone among the coniferous trees of this woodland, able to bask in the natural beauty of this solitary refuge. The tall trees block out well over half the sun's avaricious attempts to coat the earth with its rays. The streams of light which do cut through the dancing limbs sway hypnotically in time with the shifting breezes.*

		*Turning his attention to the fauna, Ormenos listens as the birds sing out their greivances regarding his presence. He is an intruder in their land, just as he has always seemed to be no matter where he goes. Indeed, it was in great part this feeling of being the perpetual outcast which led him to joining the Order in the first place.*

		*And so Ormenos' mind finally shifts to his home. Jeran township limits are only a day's journey through this ancient forest. But no one dares come this way, as the Enclave have done their part to make sure the Forest of Deception deserved its name. None who are not of the Order have ever penetrated the forest for as they enter, all sense of direction is lost and the would be interloper simply returns to their point of origin.*

Though hesitant at first, Thetian realizes that regardless of what the circumstances leading to Ormenos' flight may be, he could not leave his Brother and mentor alone to his madness. Thus, Thetian boldly decides to embark on his journey to an uncertain future with Ormenos.
		
		Still, what could Ormenos have witnessed to cause such a drastic change of heart. His words clearly could not convey the desperation his actions so easily show. These thoughts, among others, possess Thetian as he slips into a trance from the rhythmic footwork of fleeing through the forest...*
