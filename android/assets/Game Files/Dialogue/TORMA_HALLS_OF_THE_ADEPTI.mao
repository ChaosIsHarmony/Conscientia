		*Two massive hearths evenly roast cheerful groups of magi, basting them in thick swaths of sweat. A far cry from the chilled austerity of the halls or the Mathetia, laughter and jocularity seem to permeate the room, emanating from the myriad groups like steam from a duck on the spit. If ever there were a serious conversation had here, it would be as out of place as Biracul in a brothel.*

		*Frigid bones quickly thawing, Ormenos looks around for a place to rest. Though Ormenos looks only half-heartedly, as nary a chair would be empty at this time of day. Months' worth of fatigue hits his weary Falseflesh all at once, buckling his knees. A hand reaches for the doorframe to stabilize the crumbling mage. Resigned laughter weakly leaves his lips no louder than dying whispers. Unintentionally he loses the reins to his Falseflesh and unintentionally he regains them. Nothing is within his control.*

		*Ever since being assigned to the Wayfarer, the Inquisitor has been a man obsessed, intent on being the one to succeed where so many other Thought-Weavers had failed. Yet despite his recent success, he has come to understand just how little his intent matters. Anxiety's shadow hangs over him, as it always has, completely blocking out the light of Awareness. Unknown terrors lurk within the perpetual night, waiting to claim Ormenos' little remaining sanity.*

		*But just as he is about to leave, a mage gets up at the far end of the room, freeing up a space. Opposite the man is the Inquisitor's young apprentice and fellow Jeran, Brother Mind Seer, feverishly penning his latest musings in the notebook he always seems to have at his side. This obsessiveness with details has always hindered the Mind Seer's ability to spot the tiger for wont of fixating on its stripes.*

		*Determination seeps into the hesitant lines creasing the Mind Seer's brow. He rises, politely bows his head in deference to his mentor, and makes for the underhalls. As the only two Jerans in the Order, Ormenos has always felt a bond with the Mind Seer otherwise absent in his interactions with the Brothers and Sisters of the Enclave. Like caring for a real brother - or, given their age dissimilarity, a son, perhaps.*

		*As he turns to leave, hints of whispers reach his ears, the serious tone a stark contrast to the levity that surrounds it. He listens closely, but not too intently, lest he meet the mantis' fate in its pursuit of prey. Indeed, he recalls the Phrygian admonitions on being too absorbed in a task. Proof positive is that all magi here congregated were utterly unaware of this errant group due to a devout pursuit of frivolity. No, Ormenos did not want to hunt only to then become the hunted. But if he is careful, perhaps he can pluck the prize without first tripping the wire...*

		*Warmth banishes the chill hiding in Ormenos' bones. So subtly did the greedy halls rob him of heat that he barely even noticed. Only now in the presence of warmth does he realize just how little he had remaining. The Inquisitor had often thought this of Time, but for the first time he seems to connect the two events, wondering what other resource of his now slowly, imperceptibly diminishes beyond his awareness...*

		*Embers fade to ash, the dying breaths of the Calefactory's two great fires. The moon has risen and all magi should be in their quarters. Should be. Yet, crystalline laterns carve light from the shadows, revealing a sizeable crowd, all of the Enforcer caste given their cloaks. Where there should be none, dozens congregate. This breach of protocol is just another mystery tickling the Inquisitor's greatest weakness: his curiosity.*

Some answers he likely knows, others are genuine mysteries, ripe for the unraveling.*

		*Ormenos walks into his cell, his haven, at long last awakening ever so slightly from his deadened trance. Here he finally feels the reins of the Choir lift a little. Here he can be finally just be, no pretense, no interpreting the minds of others, no complex emotional labyrinths to traverse. Just the act of existing, finally free.
		
		As he steps into the room, it fills with the resplendent light emitted from the glass suspended upon the wall. This object is the proof of his station as a senior among magi and all seniors of all castes receive this relic of the ancient Thiuda as a token for their service to the Order. Ormenos need but imagine any scene and upon its glassy surface will this be reflected. As a creature of habit, Ormenos tends not to let his imagination run wild and all he sees are the waves breaking near the barnacled piers of Jer.*

		He rages against his weakness, rages against the crippling complacency with which he has conducted his affairs throughout his miserable life. He vows that someday he will break free from the curse of fear and forge his own destiny...*

		*Ormenos races, breathlessly into his room. He packs his travel sack with great haste, lest he be stopped mid-flight. The Enclave is no longer a refuge, but then again, it seems it never was. The ancient demons responsible for the demise of the Thiuda had only started the project anew with the Enclave. That must be it. But Ormenos refuses to become the thrall of some ancient evil. He will leave the Enclave to find the Thought Wheel of the Beginning. He will become an unassailable entity, beyond the vicious influence of these primordial malefactors of the human race.
		
		And steal away he does, with only his most precious item in tow. He must run with the utmost haste, out through the gates of the Enclave and into the Forest of Deception.*

		*Steam permeates the air, carrying upon it the heavy scent of pepper and garlic. The glistening surfaces of the roasted meats and the sizzling of the pan-fried vegetable opens the floodgates of drool pooling within Ormenos' mouth. Though he yet maintains a semblance of composure as he searches for an empty seat - a challenge perhaps even greater than deciphering the mind of the Wayfarer. For the last, unshakable, vice of the disciplined magi of the Enclave appears to be gluttonous feasting.
		
		As his eyes scan the room, he notices one of the few magi who specializes in something other than Techne: Cook Ding. His mind is unlike the others of the Order and one might hesitate to even call him a mage were it not for his extraordinary skill as a butcher. Little is known of his history, as his mind is inscrutable through mindsight, a characteristic the Kaban magi of the Enclave know all too well.
		
		Ormenos sees no available seats, so he conisders whether or not he should talk to Cook Ding to pass the time until a seat frees itself up, or simply leave and ignore the rumbling in his stomach.*
