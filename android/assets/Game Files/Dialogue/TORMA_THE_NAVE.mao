		*An impenetrable darkness cloaks the chamber, though the lengthy echoes from Ormenos' footfalls hint at its impressive dimensions. The room's sole apparent source of illumination hangs high above a broken circle of onyx humanoid statues, some twenty paces ahead. The circle opens toward Ormenos, revealing a silver throne - currently occupied. Closer inspection reveals a second, lesser source of light: behind the throne an imposing blast furnace breathes fire and spits sparks.*

		*Ormenos approaches the carpeted aperture to the circle of statues, noticing that a man of undeniable youth sits upon the silver throne. Reaching the perimeter of the circle he stops and kneels, as instructed.*

The room's sole apparent source of illumination hangs high above a broken circle of onyx humanoid statues, some twenty paces ahead. The circle opens toward Ormenos, revealing a silver throne - currently occupied by the young Thought-Weaver from the Stone Circle, Brother Babel. Closer inspection reveals a second, lesser source of light: behind the throne an imposing blast furnace breathes fire and spits sparks.*

		*In the grips of ecstasy, Ormenos cackles and its warped echo laughs back at him. The power, the absolute dominance he exhibited over the Prime Archon of the Enclave fills him with destructive delight. It is this strength he needs to protect himself from the horrors that await him in the darkness of imbalance; it is this power that will guard against those evil overlords who seek to rob him of agency...*

		*Ormenos feels a tug on his Trueflesh, a cosmic hand peeling a stubborn scab from a half-healed wound. His overwhelming sense of power diminishes as his psyche frays from the strain. Soon it is too great to bear and the skin of his Falseflesh begins to rip apart. All Ormenos can do is laugh at the ruby fountains streaming from his flesh. He laughs a journey from amusement to terror and then on to resentment, stopping finally at resignation; soon the laughs turn to whimpers, and last to silence. The agony so severe, so complete, forces sleep upon the broken mage...*

		*Having reached an agreement, Babel summons Ormenos into the inner circle of statues. He points to the copper disk beneath the throne. Ormenos walks upon it. The Prime Archon then calls to mind the Glyph of Nearcasting. The throne as well as the platform upon which it stands begins to glow until both magi dissolve into nothing but pure light...*

		*Ormenos' Falseflesh reforms upon a copper platform. He now sits in a throne, greeted by the myriad unmoving eyes of onyx statues. These form a ring around him, some twenty paces wide, and mark the edge of all illumination. The shadows beyond seem to pulse, waiting for the light to weaken, waiting to consume everything with unadulterated absence...*

		*He jumps from the throne and rushes out of the circle, into the darkness, stumbling upon the invisible, uneven stones that tile the floor. He knows not what this place could be, but intuits it is the Archon's Apse. His inexplicable knowledge of this is almost as disconcerting as the existence of the forbidden chamber itself.*

Went directly to the Nave	
	[/ENCLAVE!THE NAVE!HALL OF RECKONING!0.00100!DESCRIPTION!]
		||
		*Ormenos approaches the massive wooden doors leading to the Nave. They stand like two lone trees clinging to an otherwise barren cliffside. Out of place to be sure, but somehow majestic because of their oddity. Etched deep into their collective surface is one lonely symbol - alone because it is all that needs be there - the very symbol of the Enclave. Four alpha omega chimeras stare inward toward a single point, never quite touching at it; four corners suggest a broken square containing them. Shivers sneak their way down his spine - the unwelcome prelude to his ritual whenever he comes to speak before the Choir.*

		||
        *The doors begin to fade, breaking the silence not with their own noise but with the din that comes from beyond them, from within the Nave itself. Ormenos enters, walking into a hall much longer than it is wide. Countless unseeing eyes stare down from vaulted ceilings and out from painted walls; here extravagant gilded depictions of familiar Vanquished mythology adorn the six directions. Infamously anything but reserved when it came to their artwork, the Vanquished left behind countless frescoes and mosaics never quite equalled by the bumbling hands that tried to imitate them after the Great Awakening.*

		*Crystal windows illuminate the hall brighter than noontime on a cloudless day, even despite being in the depths of the earth - a miracle of Vanquished artifice. Their light reflects upon the golden walls, sparkling and crackling, igniting a raging conflagration of pure decadence.*

		*Lining the halls are dozens of red and black marble pillars, so highly polished that vague ghosts of the wall frescoes seem to reflect from their shiny surfaces. Between the supports, ornate wooden pews sit in neatly ordered rows with scores of Enclaveans seated upon them. Some come to present their findings on matters of lesser import and others merely to listen to such reports. For some it is more important to discover; for others, to remember.*

		*Beyond the benches, a curtained balcony stares down from on high - the mysterious veiled face of the Choir itself. Beneath it, a narrowing set of stairs lead a half-story below toward an unremarkable wooden door, scarcely tall enough for human use. The door is a focal point for novice gossip and speculation; none know where it leads for certain. But this wonder soon fades as the enigma becomes familiar, and ignorance becomes accepted as a matter of course. Sometimes Ormenos wonders if he is the only Senior member who has not forgotten this hole in their collective knowledge.*

		*Just as Ormenos' audience with the Choir comes to its end, the young and impetuous Enforcer known as the Jinn Slayer throws open the massive wooden doors of the hall. Despite his youth and inexperience, he already has a lengthy history of grandiloquence and... spontaneity. Were it not for his clear talents as an Enforcer, he would have likely been cast into the depths of the Vault mere weeks after joining. 
		
		Yet here he is, not more than half a year into his tenure among the magi of the Enclave and causing a ruckus which will inevitably end in some sort of disciplinary action.*

		*Not wishing to stay a moment longer in this crowded cage, Ormenos inches his way towards the now open doors and away from the cluster of overly curious magi. The yoke of subjugation to the Choir's will placed firmly upon his shoulders, Ormenos falls into a dream-like state where he shifts his feet, as of habit, to the rhythm of the Choir's hypnotic orders... He was commanded to relax, to enjoy a well-deserved rest, and thus the choice is clear: he is to travel to his room, without interruption and without hesitation.*

		*Ormenos steps down from the dais and loses himself in the crowd sufficiently to be forgotten. As he does so, the Jinn Slayer hastily makes his way past Ormenos and to the front to report upon matters of great urgency... Or at least such can be surmised given his flagrant disregard for the reports that were to precede his impromptu speech...*

		*Just as Ormenos' audience with the Choir comes to its end, the young and impetuous Enforcer known as the Jinn Slayer throws open the massive wooden doors of the hall. Despite his youth and inexperience, he already has a lengthy history of grandiloquence and... spontaneity. Were it not for his clear talents as an Enforcer, he would have likely been cast into the depths of the Vault mere weeks after joining. 
		
		Yet here he is, not more than half a year into his tenure among the magi of the Enclave and causing a ruckus which will inevitably end in some sort of disciplinary action.*
