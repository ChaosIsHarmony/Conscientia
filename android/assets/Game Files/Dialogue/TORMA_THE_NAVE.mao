		*The Archon's Apse. This is a place neither heard of nor spoken of among the magi of the Order. It is unknown but to two magi of a single generation.
		
		An impenetrable darkness pervades the chamber, thus obfuscating its true dimensions. The only source of illumination hangs high above a circle of onyx humanoid statues. The light appears to cascade downards from its source in rippling waves, tracing out the upper half of a sphere. The nearly closed circle of statues opens toward the entrance to the apse, revealing a silver throne with but a single individual seated upon it. Behind the throne is an imposing blast furnace, breathing fire and spitting sparks.*

		*Ormenos approaches the carpeted aperture to the circle of statues, noticing that a man of undeniable youth sits upon the silver throne. Reaching the perimeter of the circle he stops and kneels, as instructed.*

		An impenetrable darkness pervades the chamber, thus obfuscating its true dimensions. The only source of illumination hangs high above a circle of onyx humanoid statues. The light appears to cascade downards from its source in rippling waves, tracing out the upper half of a sphere. The nearly closed circle of statues opens toward the entrance to the apse, revealing a silver throne with but a single individual seated upon it: the youthful Thought-Weaver from the Stone Circle, Brother Babel. Behind the throne is an imposing blast furnace, breathing fire and spitting sparks.*

		*In the grips of ecstasy, Ormenos cackles and its vile echo laughs back at him. The power, the absolute destruction, annihilation and domination over one such as the Prime Archon of the Enclave fills him with delight. It is this strength he needs to protect himself from the horrors that await him in the darkness of madness - those evil overlords who seek to rob him of agency and violate his right to a peaceful existence...
		
		But, not all is right, for Ormenos feels the tug of something on his Trueflesh, as though trying to peel a stubborn scab from an unhealed wound. His overwhelming sense of power diminishes as his psyche frays from the strain. Soon it is too great to bear and the skin of his Falseflesh begins to rip apart. The agony so severe, so complete forces sleep to fall upon Ormenos...*

		*Having reached an agreement, Babel summons Ormenos into the inner circle of statues and upon a copper disk. The Prime Archon then calls to mind a familiar Glyph: Nearcasting. The throne as well as the platform upon which it stands begins to glow until both magi's forms dissolve into nothing but pure light...*

		*Ormenos begins to reform upon a copper platform, though he appears to be seated upon a throne surrounded by the glaring eyes of onyx statues in a room devoid of any light save a white crystalline array hanging high above, illuminating only the furthest reaches of the circle itself. Sensing an incredible heat, Ormenos turns his head to see an ominous blast furnace, spitting sparks and breathing fire.*

		*Jumping up from the throne, Ormenos rushes out of the circle and into the darkness, stumbling upon the uneven stones that tile the floor. He knows not what this place could be, but inexplicably intuits it is the Archon's Apse. The availabilty of this information is almost as disconcerting as the existence of this forbidden chamber itself.*

		*Now crawling upon the ground attempting to find the walls of the chamber, Ormenos dives into the void, the light of the circle ever-diminshing as he panickedly crawls away from it. But no walls are to be found, no sounds to be heard in this impenetrable darkness. And soon the light disappears altogether, leaving the confused mage trembling in fear at the uncertainty of what will become of him.*

The Vanquished were infamously anything but reserved when it came to their artwork.*

		*Lining the halls are dozens of marbled pillars and behind them, ornate wooden pews. Upon the rows of wooden benches sit many magi of the Order. Some come to present their findings on matters of lesser import and others merely to listen to such reports. For some it is more important to discover; for others, to remember.*

Beneath it are stairs leading a half-story below toward a most humble wooden door, barely tall enough for human use. The balcony is reserved for the elusive Choir of Archons.*

The yoke of subjugation to the Choir's will placed firmly upon his shoulders, Ormenos falls into a dream-like state where he shifts his feet, as of habit, to the rhythm of the Choir's hypnotic orders... He was commanded to relax, to enjoy a well-deserved rest, and thus the choice is clear: he is to travel to his room, without interruption and without hesitation.*

		*Ormenos walks through the intricately carved wooden doors and into a hall many times longer than it is wide, with vaulted ceilings and extravagant gilded depictions of familiar Vanquished mythology adorning the six directions. The Vanquished were infamously anything but reserved when it came to their artwork.*

		*Crystal windows illuminate the hall so brightly that one might suspect it were noon on a cloudless day; certainly none would ever think the hall to be in the depths of the earth as it is. This exuberant radiance reflects upon the golden walls, sparkling and crackling, igniting a raging conflagration of pure decadence.*

		*Lining the halls are dozens of marbled pillars and behind them, ornate wooden pews. Upon the rows of wooden benches sit many magi of the Order. Some come to present their findings on matters of lesser import and others merely to listen to such reports. For some it is more important to discover; for others, to remember.*

		*Beyond the multitudinous rows of wooden benches lining the hall is a curtained balcony, raised far too high for Ormenos to reach. Beneath it are stairs leading a half-story below toward a most humble wooden door, barely tall enough for human use. The balcony is reserved for the elusive Choir of Archons. None but the Archons know the identity of the Choir, yet it is the aspiration of many a bright-eyed mage to rise to the rank of Archon, for this is the ultimate height of awareness and knowledge.*

		*Ormenos enters the decadent Hall of Reckoning escorted by several Enforcers. The ostentatious, gilded walls and ceilings reflect an effulgent, crystalline light, severely straining his highly dilated pupils. Never has he been summoned before by the Choir as a deliquent and he is completely on edge as a result.
