		*Bones and sinew weave a shell as they are rebuilt from the life-fire of the ether. Ormenos now stands upon a copper disk in a dusty chamber where he is confronted with the cold, glaring eyes of scores of Thiudan Neverborn. Though the Enclavean brother has seen their ilk many times before, Ormenos remains unnerved by the motionless sentries.*

		*Relics from the exodus of Thiuda lay scattered about, three to every Neverborn at least. Some on desks equally ancient, others on shelves, and still some too large to be housed in any casing.
		
		Though numerous the relics may be, only two objects truly tug at Ormenos' attention. One is a judgment dais, similar to the one in the Hall of Reckoning, he notes, with the only difference being the circle of bones decorating this one's base. The second is simpler, and perhaps less grim: an altar, with several lit candles atop it.*

		*A blinding light cascades down from the ceiling, showering his form in rays of the purest white and forcing the sharpness of surrounding objects far into the shadowy background. He now sees nothing but the pillar of light in which he stands. He brings his hands up to his eyes, yet even they are invisible to him. Closer, closer, ever-closer, he keeps halving the distance, over and over, yet never reaching his face.*

		*Executors final words echo out across the chamber, each dying repetition seeming to heat the room. Soon, bubbles of air form beneath Ormenos' skin, bursting when they exceed capacity. Blood evaporates instantly upon contact with the air. Muscles begin to melt and bones dissolve, yet somehow he feels no pain - a small mercy.*

		*At the edge of madness, Ormenos reels in fear from the tenebrous chasm. This instinct is what has kept him alive during his horrifying investigations. It is what helped him survive some of the most perverse minds the Enclave has ever detained for Thought Draining. He knows, this is why he is so good at what he does.*

		*Cautiously, Ormenos approaches the strange altar. Six digits rise skyward from the a giant palm of solid onyx, curving inwards at their tips. Cloudy jade fingernails each host candles burning with undying and unflinching flames. Red wax flows down the nails' gentle slopes, dripping towards the palm, but vanishing before ever reaching it.
		
		Just who or what this altar venerates is uncertain, but whatever the object of worship may be, it was likely invaluable to the Order's Thiudan ancestors. The very fact that any religious rites or altars exist in their fiercely materialistic civilization speaks volumes to how highly they must have valued it.*

Though originally invisible to Ormenos, from this very specific perspective it welcomes sight. The inquisitive mage briefly forgets his apprehension and leans in to examine it more closely. It is a memory crystal, raw and incompatible with a Muninn. He would need a Vanquished reading device to decipher its contents, a device only the grovekeepers guard jealously...*

        *Yet, something is different... something strange. A presence, a force, some beastly creature within him hungers. On the brink of starvation he feels like screaming, like howling. He longs to absorb the crystal's essence right into his Trueflesh. He yearns to forget the pain of this hunger, though he knows this will not cure it. Only one prey will sate him, but until then, this meager meal will have to suffice.*

		*From the depths of the Graylands a Glyph materializes. Gracefully loping from the shadows into the forefront of awareness, Ormenos recognizes the Glyph of Extraction made form. The fog seems to coalesce into memory, bringing with it awareness. Though he knows not why, Ormenos remembers Fenrir; he remembers their pact, made in forgotten eras with characters beyond Ormenos' ken. Fenrir has come to honor their convenant by consuming the crystal's energy and leaving bare its contents.*

		*Ormenos turns his attention once more to the adumbral chamber. Eyes immediately search for the ruby he emptied. Its memories resonate with his Trueflesh, sympathetic threads whispering across the fabric of time.
		
		But as attractive as the familiar may be, what is already known holds little sway over the inquisitive mage's attention. Discipline will help light his path through the shadows of ignorance; Discipline will wring knowledge from those who seek to cast shadows; Discipline will free Ormenos from fear... This has always been his hope.*

One is a judgment dais, similar to the one in the Hall of Reckoning, he notes, with the only difference being the circle of bones decorating this one's base.

		*Ormenos squints as tears blur his vision. Entering the grove from the darkness of the halls is no less than stepping into a midday summer from a wintery midnight. Light burns his eyes, tormenting him like an unwanted truth. Myriad crystals here ensure that light is in no short supply, as they droop from Huginn branches like ripened fruits. But where there is light there are also shadows, the ever-present promise that the light will wane. The shadows shift, however, with the movement of crystals being carefully transported between the trees.*

They are responsible for the search of lost arts of the Thiuda and their Vanquished predecessors.

		*Ormenos walks through the unassuming, arched corridor opening up into a chamber so large its entirety eludes his field of vision. There are several thousands of stories composing this cyclopean structure. Yet the centre is an open space, light cascading down from the massive aperture at the top of this hollowed out mountain. Myriad rooms are carved into the rocky skin of the mountain's interior as they impertinently and defiantly spiral their way toward heaven, as though a warning to any celestial denizens that the magi of the Enclave would too transcend the terrestial and usurp their heavenly throne.
		
		At the centre of the circular ground floor stands a Muninn tree so large, that it appears to have exceeded the height of its mountain home. Knotted, pearlescent branches reach forth from its mighty trunk, yearning for and growing towards the white crystals whence they derive their energy.
		
		Extending forth from its base are concentric rows of tables filled with scores of scholarly magi, studying, researching, ever-chasing the shadows of ignorance from their minds with the torch of Discipline.*

		As a Thought-Weaver, Ormenos regularly haunts the Vault down in the Third Sphere, but many moons ago when he had first arrived, he would spend countless hours in these Archives, devouring the knowledge his predecessors had left. Indeed, he cannot help but feel a small bout of nostalgia creep up upon him as he decides where to direct his feet.*

		Alas, Ormenos is incapable of communing with the trees of his own power for he lacks the Techne and the powerful artifacts of the Archivists. Thus, he must content himself with the warm glow of the Order's collective knowledge growing before his very eyes. But as there is nothing for him to do here, he is forced to abandon the grove to its caretakers.*

Thinking about each step he had taken from boyhood to magehood, how he has progressively whittled away the savagery of ignorance, but further how his destination lies still further on, at some undisclosed, unknowable point in the ever-tenative future. These thoughts help him to recall the words of the Phrygian wisemen about how the destination is secondary to the journey itself, or something to that effect.

		*As he crosses the threshold leading to the Scriptorium, Ormenos loses all sense of time and space. The aromatics spicing the air relaxes the weary mage; the dull glow of a crystalline candelabra casts but the faintest light allowing no clear vision beyond the tip of his nose; the rhythmic beats of scattered percussionists and the melodic lull of the strings soothes his racing mind.*

		*Stumbling over a hill of throw pillows, Ormenos takes a dive into the ground only to penetrate it, sinking deeply into a viscous ether. Ever-deeper, the light fades away, taking all sorrow, worry, excitation, anticipation, and emotion altogether along with it. The ineffable state Ormenos now falls into washes away the stains of the imagined, leaving behind only that which is. He feels as though in a profound sleep, but with an unparalleled awareness uncharacteristic of his waking life or even his dreams for that matter.*

		*Emerging from the sea of cleansing ether he witnesses his physical form, the Falseflesh he had apparently left behind, now reclining among the throw pillows and alongside a fellow mage, of countenance so relaxed, so unperturbed as to be urecognizable as human, a mirror image of his own. Indeed, it's difficult to tell if Ormenos is merely staring into a mirror or if he has simply become inextricably intertwined his Sister who so serenely accompanies him in this Scriptorium.*

Could this be the first time he has acted of his own volition? Yet as he acts in ignorance of his motivations, he suspects the strings are still attached, but the puppeteer was never the Choir to begin with.

		*The dust lies thick upon most corners of this vast chamber. Anachronistic braziers burn tirelessly, casting a smoky haze about the room. A natural spring bisects the room, cascading down from the ceiling, pooling into a shallow well and finally exiting to parts unknown through a discreet point of egress. This pristine water seems to feed a luscious and overgrown underground garden lit by an array of several brilliant crystals.
		
		Here lie much of the discarded and broken fragments of Vanquished and Thiudan artifacts - untended, unimportant, unwanted. The ancient societies to whom these objects once belonged birthed the magnificent Huginn and Muninn groves; their wisdom gave the Path of Discipline; their diligence amassed the innumerable volumes which line the Great Spiral Path, ascending skywards in the foyer of Mathetia. 
		
		It is only because those who preceded worked tirelessly that the current generation can enjoy the fruits of their labors; and it is thus the Enclaveans endeavor to ensure this well of intellectual riches does not dry up for the generations to come.
		
		But seeing these forgotten and damaged relics of the past, Ormenos cannot help but feel a tinge of futility stain his Enclavean sense of pride. Countless unnamed and unremembered individuals exhuasted their life force to yield only feeble fruits, if any at all. Will he too be lost in the mire of history?*
