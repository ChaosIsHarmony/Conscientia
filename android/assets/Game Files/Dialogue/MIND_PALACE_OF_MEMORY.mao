		*Robbed of sight as we are, blind we are not. Our ally, the deft oarsman, heeds not the illusions of the eyes, guided instead by the wailing winds. He listens Nature's song, to the waves echoing off the seabed's crusty fingers, off the stony claws reaching out from the waters and threatening to drag us under to the destruction of the Falseflesh.*

And more than this, prophecies, nay, memories - for what are prophecies but memories of the future? - indeed, according to memories told from other lives, other journeys, it is here that we finally meet.*

		*An emphatic crack punctuates with echoing finality his last words, and our boat docks into the archaic peer. This island appears to house numerous structures from Vanquished eras, the dock among them, fashioned with a precision and cunning beyond even the treacherous Thiudan's capabilities. Seamless stones fitted together and unmoved for uncounted spans of forgotten time, as though yet awaiting their cruel masters' return. The winds and waters in alliance for centuries have failed to so much as chip the edges of these docks. Clearly the All-Seer will not allow his servants to soon forget the hubris of their sinful ancestors...*

		*But more memories of the fallen come in the form of a sweeping beam of intense light. It cuts through the very fog and illuminates the path through the craggy and perilous shore like some false Biracul! Though one misstep here would mean certain death, should we sinners not trust in the All-Seer's plan? What work of witchcraft is it that causes false light to chase fog from the very air which spawned it? Such an ominous Techne does much to make one ill-at-ease in this wretched land.*

		*Rikharr hosts silent Hel within his shell and seeks to ease the pain of the living Kavans. He was once their mage, but neglected his duties in pursuit of self-centered knowledge. This knowledge now drives him to act for his people, accelerating their destruction, eliminating the need to struggle with the despair that entropy, that Hel, promises for all.
		
		No phoenix will be able to rise from the ashes Rikharr plans to leave. He will salt these lands, giving a destruction most thorough. Not even nothingness will be able to grow from the ruins.
		
		The Sun Tower will be first. A symbol of the victory his people will achieve in death. He summons from the depths of his ghost a destructive Glyph to make rubble of the base. Yet in doing so, he cedes his agency to the void nestled within him. The result, a complete erasure of the second story of the tower. 
		
		As the second story begins to phase out of existence, his concentration wavers and the Techne's effects are incomplete, but they are nonetheless devastating. Losing its supports, the upper floors of the tower leans, eventually succumbing to gravity and diving into the canyon.
		
		The unprepared garrison residing within cry in anguish. They scream from fright and desperation in equal measure, as the tower cascades down toward the canyon floor. Fortunate they are, then, as their trip ends with an abrupt and violent impact into the earth ending all fear they might have had with a mercifully instantaneous death.*

Easily dispatching these uncoordinated stragglers, the draugnir then join with the advancing Rikharr who has already begun his trek across the gargantuan bridge spanning the canyon.
		
		But it seems that Kavu is not caught completely off-guard, as a familiar face rears itself giving obstacle to Rikharr's vanguard of draugnir: Ark, then Librarian, now Archmage of all Kavu and its peoples. She will not be dissuaded by Rikharr's impassioned appeal to free the people from the tyranny of the Others. Their conflict is now inevitable.
		
		The battle is as expected of an Archmage and the host of the void demon, Hel: as ineffable as it is awe-inspiring. No, none present can comprehend the dark Technes being summoned from the abyss and used to destroy; nor can they fathom the sheer divinity of the protective Techne's Ark conjures up from the Empyrean to preserve the lives of her Valvorthr.
		
		After exhuasting all other options, Ark drives Luin through the bowels of Rikharr, pinning him to the bridge. To all's surprise he does not perish, but is at the very least, incapacitated, giving the Valvorthr time enough to rout the jinn-cursed draugnir.*

		*Ark and her followers are victorious, but she is at a loss as to how best to detain her former master. As she and her Valvorthr discuss their plan to incarcerate him in the Wellspring of Dazir, a blue-cloaked individual emerges from the dust of the Wastes and approaches a cagey Ark.
		
		The stranger claims he is the Biracul of Kavan lore, and requests of Ark that she replace Rikharr as the vessel for the dangerous creature Hel; for only she is strong enough to withstand the solitude which awaits the vessel in the Dungeon of the Void.
		
		His words sway her; she understands what she must do and accepts her sacred charge, her duty to the All-Seer. In an excruciating act of faith, she absorbs the scourge of the Wastes and, after extraordinary pain, becomes its new vessel.
		
		Instructing her Valvorthr to take the still breathing Rikharr into the Hall of Atonement and guard him until her return, she departs with Biracul for the dungeon of the old and ruined city of Urugh.*

		*And somehow here my Self arrives back at the beginning, just when it seemed my dream had ended. For all did end with His creation, did it not? Yet still, my feet have taken me, as of habit, to the exceeding austerity of the Zhilian steppe. Back to my homeland.*

		||
		*Indeed, the place of my birth. Before there was the Prophetess, the Eidos, there was only Torma, the mischievous little steppe-dweller of the Zhilian people.
		
		Our wind-swept land punishes the meek. But make no mistake, there is no reciprocity from humans here, no battle with Mother Nature here. Just as no fool would ever hope to ensare Brother Sun, so too do we regard Mother with singular and sacrosanct deference. Rather, the task is to gain Her respect through overcoming the harsh trials She has laid out before us. 
		
		Not all win Her respect in the end, but my people have for centuries persevered, thus gaining Her protection. As proof it suffices to note that not even the Blood-Drinkers dare to come to these barren highlands.*

		*Indeed, His creation, the sacred mission that excised my Falseflesh from its homeland. But to give rise to the Shining One was my divine mission and now that it is done, my Self again returns to the wind-swept Zhilian steppe at a time before my awareness of the sparkling verses of Biracul, a time before the betrayal of awareness. Even now, my Self cannot help but think that He would choose me as the Eidos, defies all logic. Yet as it was decided, so it was done.
		
		Turning my attention back to the vision of my homeland, my Self observes the stubborn grasses clawing their way up from the chilled soil to gather Brother Sun's bounty. Uncle Wind whispers cold tales from travels to lands unknown and Sister Cloud carves her path across the Sky. It wells up within me an ineffable sense of serenity.*

		*However, despite the alluring verisimilitude of the scenery, it is evident that this is nothing but a spectre of a memory. Merely that which once was, but no longer is. 
		
		In truth, only the All-Seer could revisit what to us is past. As a shadow is to its caster, and the caster is to the light of Brother Sun, so are we to the All-Seer. So foreign, so far-removed, but nonetheless so inexorably linked.
		
		And so, my Self looks upon its beginnings from its end, seen with detachment and with incontrovertible knowledge of its illusory nature. This, the closed loop of my existence.	Life has become a dream - or perhaps only at the end does one realize it always was.*

		*Even so, in this shadow world my Self remains, chasing one foot with the other, left and right vying to be the first to arrive. Faster and faster they move until they break into a dash, the speed peeling layers of time and memory from my Falseflesh. 
		
		The summer rains begin to chase away the autumn winds and then the frozen winters succeed the fertile springs. Over and over the cycle repeats, returning my Trueflesh to the innocent youth of its origins, to a time before knowledge tainted its core.*
