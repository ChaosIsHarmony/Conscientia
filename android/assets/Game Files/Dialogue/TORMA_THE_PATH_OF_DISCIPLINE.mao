		*Passing through the portal, Ormenos now enters a room filled with stacks upon stacks of volumes copied from the imposing Archives of the Enclave. The knowledge is in utter disarray with titles sorted seemingly at random, and utterly inaccessible as there are towers of tomes stacked at thrice the height of an average Muninn tree.
		
		What's more, is that there are countless doors lining the walls with no clear indicator as to which will lead to progress and which to nowhere.
		
		The whirring commences and the voice of the Arbiter speaks unto the Inquisitor's mind.*

		*With the slightest hint of pride welling up within him, Ormenos enters the chamber of the final trial, a hemispheric room with massive black panels blanketing the ceiling. The silver throne at the center, inevitable in all Vanquished ruins, appears to be the seat of control over the Path's Thought Wheel.
		
		But what is less palatable is that there is clearly someone already occupying this throne. Call it a doppelganger, an illusory twin or whatever is most convincing, but the fact is that this individual is indistinguishable from Ormenos himself. In fact, he is both seeing himself walk into the room and sitting in the chair simultaneously; perceiving the scene from two perspectives in synchronous simultaneity, each's perception every bit as real as the other's.
		
		Then, the enthroned Ormenos rises and directly in front of and in between the two bewildered magi, appears a most prodigious slope with a most imposing boulder placed atop. The boulder is of dimensions coequal to an Ormenos' height in all three planes. The slope's sudden appearance at first startles the twinned magi, though quickly they realize that it may have been here all along and only gave the appearance of phasing into existence when it finally drew their attention.
		
		Queerly, both Ormenos and his mirror-self stand across the way from each other, one at the center and the other on the periphery of the presumably flat chamber, yet by some trick of magic or artifice the slope seems to ascend from both perspectives.*

		*Ormenos stands carelessly in the path of the boulder as it dispassionately charges at him, seeking to press the very marrow from his bones. Content to let the universe decide for him, he regards the massive stone orb coldly up until the very moment it is but a hair's breadth away, when it stops abruptly, as though time itself had frozen. In obedience to the edicts of the universe, the assaulted Ormenos feels compelled to casually nudge it back toward the other Ormenos, who reciprocates.

		*Diving for cover, Ormenos cowers in fear, eyes closed tighter than a miser's purse strings as the boulder dispassionately charges toward him, seeking to press the very marrow from his bones. Shivering in his mage's robes, he waits to hear the inevitable collision and obliteration of the stone upon the surface of the dome. But his expectations remain unrequited.

		His trembling ceases when he looks up to see that the stone orb has stopped abruptly right at the base of the slope, just as though time itself had frozen. Perhaps in shame for his cowardice, or perhaps in retribution for the mirror Ormenos' inane act of treachery, the slighted Ormenos kicks the boulder back towards the instigating Ormenos at the center of the room, who likewise cowers in fear and then, under similar motivations, propels the boulder back towards his assailant.
		
		Back and forth, they cower at and thrust the boulder in turn. Suddenly the whirring of the Thought Wheel causes the dark panels to hum and glow, one-by-one giving birth to an image of an Ormenos pair engaging in the devious and seemingly pointless act of repeatedly rolling a boulder to try to harm the other Ormenos.

Yet when it is but a hair's breadth away, it stops abruptly, as though time itself had frozen. The other Ormenos laughs derisively at this Ormenos' attempt to stop the boulder.
		
		In a fit of rage and bravado, the threatened Ormenos propels the boulder back in the direction whence it came, this time with even greater force! The throne-side Ormenos likewise braces for impact, receives mockery from the assailing Ormenos and now, even angrier, sends the rocky sphere careening back.
		
		An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth, until all available body parts have been annihilated in turn! Suddenly the whirring of the Thought Wheel causes the dark panels to buzz and glow, one-by-one giving birth to an image of an Ormenos pair engaging in the savage and seemingly pointless act of repeatedly rolling a boulder to try to harm the other Ormenos.

Suddenly, the clouds part and the sun shines through, casting the silhouette of an anthropomorphic fowl in stark contrast. The Caw also aroused the allies of the Skylord, as the Mushroom Duke charges with his fungal army toward the dispassionate stone orb. Many fall under the crushing weight of the sphere and all hope seems to wane as the boulder approaches, ever faster, ever closer!
		
		But the Master of the Skies swoops down from on high and with a mighty flap of His feathered wings, He blasts the boulder back whence it came!
		
		In a fit of ecstasy, the throne-side Ormenos likewise invokes the most sacred of Caws, repeating this bizarre, cyclical rhapsody - a cycle which would normally continue ad infinitum, except the floral and faunal warriors appear to tire of the cycle and take breaks to smoke and gamble in between, while the stones and both Ormenoses patiently wait.
		
		But then at long last, the Arbiter makes its final appearance...*

		But there is no rest for the weary, as the familiar whirring sound acts as a prelude to the voice of the Arbiter.*

		*The mysterious carpet slowly carries its passenger toward the watery surface of this room, but stops roughly twice Ormenos' height from the water itself. The mage scans about, seeing if there might be an appropriate place to alight and in so doing, his eyes fall upon the unusual sight of a wide river traveling upwards along the surface of the dome, disappearing into a hole at the top.
		
		However, his exploratory gazes reveal no solid ground upon which to alight, and the conspicuous absence of Arbiter's resounding voice troubles him thoroughly.*

		*Ormenos digs through his pockets for some unwanted item he can cast into the unknown profundity of fluid beneath him, before he casts himself. He extracts a small stone replica of the Biracul, the handiwork of Cook Ding from the Refectory. Though a gift rich in artistry, its purpose would best be served to test the proverbial waters, and thus Ormenos launches it over the side of the carpet.
		
		In the space of a thought, it collides with the water's surface and, much to the Inquisitor's surprise, it bounces upon the surface several times before finally coming to rest against the surface as though it were rock solid.

		Ormenos thinks back to the Path he has taken and to all the - likely apocryphal - historical mythology he has encountered along the way.

Odd how even the Biraculian tradition of mindless sheep espoused this belief. Oh, yes, Ormenos could still quote the Biraculian Verses.

		*Guided by the sounds of rushing water, Ormenos marches forth into the next chamber. Here he sees a grotto bisected by a subterranean river, along whose edges grow a vibrant, emerald moss. Pools of stagnant water - vile and rank, surely poisonous to the touch, judging from the vast array of toxic substances calling them home - likewise dot the floor.
		
		Once more, the deafening voice of the Arbiter rings out.*

		*...Pale light from crystalline sconces pours in to the gradually opening eyes of the fallen mage. An indeterminate amount of time has elapsed since his collapse to the cavern floor.
		
		He props himself up, but promptly empties the contents of his stomach - the unpropitious effect of standing too near the site of his devastation. Though now the noxious odor that assault Ormenos has dissipated, its effects are clear: none of the vibrant foliage of the river has survived.
		
		Truly this is a volatile ability he has gained.
		
		Subsequently, beyond the foreground scene of floral carnage comes into focus the background: a portal has revealed itself, leading onward to newer insights. Though having obtained what he came for, Ormenos wonders if perhaps it would be wise to cut his losses and go make his report to the Choir of Archons before their patience wears too thin.*
