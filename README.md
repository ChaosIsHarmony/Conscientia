This is an unmaintained project built from 2016-2017.

This was the project I used to teach myself how to program, and although it's rough (a generous descriptor), it is a milestone.

The project used the LibGDX framework to build an interactive novel with a unique and innovative personality/decision system, and deep interconnection between different books.

I was only able to completely two books (the first co-authored by Bruce Burns) before life got in the way. I would like to get back to it some day, but for now will focus on other projects.
